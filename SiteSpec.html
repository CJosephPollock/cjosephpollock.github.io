	<h1>Site Specification</h1></br>

	<p>My website will be a personal website that documents my abilities as a programmer and creative designer.  In this case, I am the client for the website.  By creating and maintaining this website, I hope to supplement and strengthen my resume by giving potential employers a summary of my experience and ability.  </p>

	<p>I want the site to contain detailed and well designed pages that describe projects I have worked on as well as provide a quick summary of my experience.  This will be done with a minimalist design. </p> 

	<p>I will measure the site’s success by completion and a finished feeling.  The site will be polished, and intuitive.  The site will be successful when I am proud to put it on a resume or tell people to check it out.  My target audience is potential employers, meaning the site will have a professional feeling to it, however this shouldn’t be mistaken for boring.  It will show I am creative and understand web development.</p>  

	<p>I want to add in some image carousels and other more advanced functionalities.  This will be a technical factor that will limit me, I believe.  I will research how to achieve that functionality and make it feasible.  I want the site to be complete and perfectly functional by the time I start next year of college.  That date is September 25th.  I think this is more than enough time to develop the website.  It may take less time if there were an already existing website, however I will be starting from scratch and writing all of the code for it.</p>






	<h1>Flowchart</h1>

	<p>The site is fairly simple, with a nav bar at the top with various links.  Home (index.html), about (about.html), projects (links to a drop down menu with individual .html’s), resume (resume.html, links to a PDF), and contact (contact.html).  When selecting a different page, it will smoothly fade between pages.  Some pages (i.e. the project pages) will require more work than others (i.e. the resume page) because they are more technically difficult and require more formatting.  All in all I am very excited for what the future holds!<p>
