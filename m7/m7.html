	<h1>Home Page</h1>
	<p>Each section in the homepage will have a brief (condensed version) that has an icon and links to the page with the full description.  The sections I will include are: About, Projects, and Contact.</p>

	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>The "About Me" page will have three columns each with an icon at the top, a section title (h2) and a paragraph.  The three different columns will be a bio, a description of my education thus far, and a description of my history of coding.</p>

	<h1>Portfolio</h1>
	<p>This will be a description of the work I have done (including links), with reviews people have given me.  It will link to websites I have worked on and other projects.  I will put as much code as possible on github for others to view.</p>

	<h1>Resume</h1>
	<p>I saw this on one of my friend's websites.  He made an interactive HTML/CSS resume.  I thought it was a fantastic idea and I plan to do the same.  It will be a more comprehensive resume, which will include the options to email it, and print a more condensed version of it.  This is the only page that will have a different header and a different footer.  I chose to do this to reduce distractions so whoever is viewing my resume can focus on just the resume.</p>

	<h1>Contact</h1>
	<p>This page will include a quick blurb that encourages the reader to contact me and then provide a variety of different outlets to do so.  The ones I listed are the ones I will use currently.  I will add more as I see fit (i.e. an eLance or other).</p>
