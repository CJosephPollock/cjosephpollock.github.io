<p>The icons all include their own whitespace, so including some in the code will not be necessary.  As far as links go, they will remain the same color regardless if they are visited.  However, if they are being hovered, I think I will include an animation that raises them a few pixels or increases their font size.  I will experiment and determine what is aesthetically pleasing. </p>
