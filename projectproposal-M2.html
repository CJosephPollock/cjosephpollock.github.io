<h2>Joe Pollock's Portfolio</h2>
<p>My website will be my personal website of my work that I could add onto a resume or onto business cards, etc.  Thus, the site title, "Joe Pollock's Portfolio".  </p>

<h2>Developer</h2>
<p>I want this website to demonstrate my knowledge and skill about web dev, and iOS development, so I will be the only developer on this project because of that. </p>

<h2>Rationale or Focus</h2>
<p>It will focus on work I have done and projects I am planning.  It will give the visitor (potential employer) a good idea of my skill level and passion for coding and development.  </p>

<h2>Main Elements Outline</h2>
<p>The website will be very clean with no ads, no clutter, and will be extremely responsive and fast.  There will be a title at the top that says, "Joe Pollock's Portfolio" with a nav bar including pages such as, Home, about, projects, resume, contact, etc.  There will be a footer with an &copy 2014, a "to the top" button, and some social media links (twitter, linked in, github, email, etc.)</p>  

<h2>Content</h2>
<p>There will probably be about 6 pages on my website.  I am still deciding whether to break up each "Project" into a different page, or just have a page that scrolls down to accomodate each project.  So in that case, there will be about 6 (not breaking the projects up) to 10 (giving each project its own page).  </p>

<h2>Target audience</h2>
<p>My target audience will be a potential employer, someone looking for freelance work, or even a potential partner.  </p>

<h2>Design Considerations</h2>
<p>I want the site to be very clean and modern.  I like the use of <a href="http://designmodo.com/blur-backgrounds-websites/">blurry backgrounds on these websites.</a>  It will not be clunky or have extraneous information that is unnecessary.</p>

<h2>Limiting Factors</h2>
<p>I think content at this point is the limiting factor.  I have a few ideas for some quick and easy iPhone apps to quickly demonstrate what I know.  I am about to be on summer vacation, so I will have time to quickly build those and set up their project pages.  Other than that, just writing compelling content and optimizing the site!</p>
