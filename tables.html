<center><h1>Use of Tables</h1></center>

	<table style="width:80vw">
		<tr>
		  <td>My website is a personal portfolio, designed to display my work, information about me, and methods with which to contact me. </td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		  <td>Tables are fantastic for presenting and organizing data. The content on my site would not benefit from the use of tables, the exception being the resume page.
		  </td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		  <td>While I think there is value to building my resume with a table, I have chosen not to. Tables would make it very easy for me to align, edit, and reorganize my resume depending on a given job application. However, first, they are aesthetically unappealing, and second, they limit the functionality I wish to have in the future. After this course, I plan on learning JavaScript and enhancing my resume with the techniques I learn (including drop down sections, etc). Implementing a table would mean undoing that work in the future to implement a more advanced layout method and features on my resume page. Because of this, I have chosen to abstain from implementing tables on my website. However, the "kitchen sink" section of my website will most likely include some table work. </td>
